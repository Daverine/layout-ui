						<p>Spy the scroll position of a page or any scrollable container and inform me about what you see in a menu. Scrollspy is used to track certain elements and tell which element the user's viewport is currently centered on. An example of how a scrollspy function is that of our table-of-contents(TOC) on the right side of this page. Clicking on a link in the TOC will also smoothly scroll the page to the element that was linked.</p>

						<div class="heading">Usage</div>
						<p>To implement a scrollspy on your page or a scrollable container, you have to put somethings in place:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>There must be a page or a container in the page that is scollable depending on where to implement the scrollspy.</li>
							<li>There must be a menu with items in it that is linked to the <code>id</code> attribute of desired elements in the page or in the scrollable container.</li>
						</ul>
							After the above requirement is in place, you have to initialize the plugin on your menu by adding the attribute <code>data-scrollspy</code>. That attribute can either have a value that is the <code>id</code> of the scollable container that you want to spy or it should not have value at all to indicate that you want to spy the page.</p>create a menu that contains items linked to a desired element in your page or a scrollable container by <code>id</code>.
